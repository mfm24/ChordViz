ChordViz
========

Harmonic and chord vizualizer.

Python program for creating and combining notes. Will play them if pyaudio is involved. If ui_decorators is installed (see http://www.socouldanyone.com/2013/07/prototyping-ui-in-python.html for details) will use that to make a rudimentary UI.

Visualization is made using SVG, rendered to a PySide widget if available. Files can also be written out to a svg compatible file.
